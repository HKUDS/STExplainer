In this paper, we propose an Explainable Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STExplainer) framework that enhances STGNNs with inherent explainability, enabling them to provide accurate predictions and faithful explanations simultaneously. Our framework integrates a unified spatio-temporal graph attention network with a positional information fusion layer as the STG encoder and decoder, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a structure distillation approach based on the Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle with an explainable objective, which is instantiated by the STG encoder and decoder. 

## Environment

Please first clone the repo and install the required environment, which can be done by running the following commands:

```shell
conda env create -n stexplainer python=3.8

conda activate stexplainer

# Torch with CUDA 11.6
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu116 torchvision==0.13.0+cu116 torchaudio==0.12.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
# Clone our STExplainer
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/STExplainer.git
cd STExplainer
# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



##  Dataset

We utilized three traffic datasets and two crime datasets to evaluate STExplainer: *PEMS4, 7, 8* (Traffic), *NYC, CHI crime* (Crime).

## Examples to run the codes

We could modify configuration at [./config](https://github.com/HKUDS/STExplainer/config) to train or test our model on different datasets. There is an example on PEMS04: 

  - train PEMS4 (note that the "testonly" in configuration file should be 0)

```shell
python train.py --config ./config/STExplainer_pems4.yaml
```

  - test PEMS4 (note that the "testonly" in configuration file should be 1, and there is a corresponding checkpoints at [./results/model](https://github.com/HKUDS/STExplainer/results/model))

```shell
python train.py --config ./config/STExplainer_pems4.yaml
```
